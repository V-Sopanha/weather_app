# Skycast Weather App

A beautiful weather application built with React, TypeScript, and Vite that shows current weather and 5-day forecast.

## Environment Variables

Before running the application, you need to set up your environment variables:

1. Copy `.env.example` to a new file named `.env`
2. Replace `your_openweathermap_api_key_here` with your actual OpenWeatherMap API key

```bash
VITE_WEATHER_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

You can get an API key by signing up at [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/api).

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

2. Run the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

3. Build for production:
```bash
npm run build
```
